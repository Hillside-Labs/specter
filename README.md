## Steps
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `cp devenv.yaml.tmpl devenv.yaml` and add your OpenAI API key
3. we python inspecter.py


## Example:
URL: [Twitter API](https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/twitter.com/current/2.61/openapi.yaml)

Audience: A startup of 8 people with an MVP

Use-cases: Data analysis

Other comments: \<empty\>
```
Query: What is the most important API endpoint?
Final Answer: The most important API endpoints for your startup, given your interest in data analysis, are likely the "createTweet" and "search/stream/rules" endpoints. The "createTweet" endpoint allows you to create tweets under an authorized account, which could be useful for generating data for analysis. The "search/stream/rules" endpoint allows for the retrieval and modification of tweets, which could be crucial for analyzing existing data. However, the importance of API endpoints can vary greatly depending on your specific use case, so it's important to thoroughly understand the functionality of all available endpoints.

Query: What is a potential chokepoint for our customers?
Final Answer: Potential chokepoints for your customers could be error handling, the complexity of the API's structure, and rate limits. Proper error handling is crucial to prevent your application from crashing or behaving unexpectedly. The complexity of the API's structure requires careful handling of parameters and responses. Lastly, be aware of potential rate limits to prevent your application from failing due to too many requests in a short period of time.

Query: Which APIs have to be monitored for cost optimization?
Final Answer: The "2/tweets/search/stream/rules" endpoint of Twitter's API should be monitored for cost optimization. This endpoint is used for adding or deleting rules from a user's active rule set. If rules are being added or deleted frequently, this could result in higher costs. Therefore, monitoring the usage of this endpoint could help in optimizing costs.

Query: What are the sources of potential customer retention risk?
Final Answer: The potential sources of customer retention risk in this API are:

1. Requirement for User Authentication: The operations "usersIdRetweets" and "usersIdFollow" require the user to be authenticated and the id of the user must match the authenticated user. This could potentially be a source of confusion or difficulty for users, leading to dissatisfaction.

2. Variety of Error Responses: Both operations return a variety of error responses, including client disconnected, client forbidden, conflict, disallowed resource, duplicate rules, invalid request, invalid rules, noncompliant rules, not authorized for field, not authorized for resource, OAuth1 permissions, operational disconnect, resource not found, resource unavailable, rule cap, streaming connection, unsupported authentication, and usage capped. These errors could potentially frustrate users if they are not handled properly. 

To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to provide clear and comprehensive documentation on how to authenticate users and handle errors. Additionally, providing responsive customer support can help to resolve any issues that users may encounter.
